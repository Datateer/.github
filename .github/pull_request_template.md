Add a brief description of the pr
Try to use terminology that is not too specific to the company or the customer.
This will help with allowing new team members contribute faster.
This will also ensure that team members working on different customers are still able to understand the scope from the description.

If you do need to use terms that are specific, add a short deffinition.
